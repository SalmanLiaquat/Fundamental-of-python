1. Basic Python Concepts

Input/Output: using print(), input().

Variables: integers, floats, strings, booleans.

Operators: arithmetic (+ - * / %), relational (== != > <), logical (and, or, not).

2. Control Structures

If/Else: decision making.

Loops: for, while, break, continue.

Examples: printing sequences, checking conditions.

3. Functions

Defined with def.

Arguments & Return Values.

Lambda Functions: lambda x: x*x.

Higher Order Functions:

map() â†’ apply function to all items.

filter() â†’ filter items by condition.

reduce() â†’ reduce items into one result.

4. Time & Space Complexity

Basics of Big O Notation.

Learned how loops & nested loops affect performance.

5. Data Structures in Python
List

Ordered, mutable.

Methods: append, extend, insert, remove, pop, sort, reverse, count, index, copy, clear.

Used for dynamic storage.

Tuple

Ordered, immutable.

Faster than lists.

Useful for fixed data.

Methods: count, index.

Set

Unordered, unique values only.

Methods: add, update, remove, discard, union, intersection, difference.

Dictionary

Keyâ€“Value pairs.

Methods: get, keys, values, items, update, pop, clear.

6. File Handling

Modes: r, w, a, rb, wb.

Open/close files with open() and close().

Read content with read(), readline(), readlines().

Write/append content with write(), writelines().

7. Mini Projects

Palindrome Check (fixing mistakes like reversing string correctly).

Finding Duplicates in a List.

Sorting Check Program (to see if list is sorted).

File Manager Project:

Create File with content.

Read File content.

Update File:

Rename file.

Overwrite content.

Append new content.

Delete File with confirmation.

Menu-driven interface using match-case.

Used pathlib.Path for handling files and folders.

8. Error Fixing & Debugging

You practiced debugging many errors (like wrong loops, missing close(), incorrect logic).

Learned why errors happen and how to correct them.

9. Extra Topics Covered

Summary of all programming languages (uses & differences).

Learned about PDF & Excel Handling:

Creating Excel files.

Converting Excel â†’ PDF in table format.

Tried to open PDF files with binary mode and explored PyPDF2.
